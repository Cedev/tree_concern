# tree-concern

A tree concern for rails models.
The `Tree` concern adds `:parent` and `:children` relationships and validates that these remain a tree.
It provides multiple ways of querying ancestors and descendants.

## Usage

### Models

Add `include Tree` to a rails model.

#### Example usage

This simple model is a `Tree` where each node in the tree has a `:name`. It was generated by running `rails generate scaffold Node name:string`

```
class Node < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Tree
  
  def to_s
    self.name + '.' + self.id.to_s
  end
end
```

### Migrations

Add `include TreeMigration` to a db migration, and `add_tree :table_name` to add the `Tree`-specific columns to a table.
This will add a "parent_id" column to the table, along with an appropriate foreign key.

The included `add_tree` will make a monomorphic relationship. Polymorphism of tree nodes is not supported.

#### Example migration

```
class CreateNodes < ActiveRecord::Migration
  include TreeMigration
  
  def change
    create_table :nodes do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.timestamps null: false
    end
    add_tree :nodes
  end
end
```

### Controllers

The `:parent` relationship is represented by a foreign key named `"parent_id"`.
In order to allow the parent to be changed add `:parent_id` to the permitted parameters (`params.permit`) in your controller.

#### Example controller

```
class NodesController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  private
    # ...

    # Never trust parameters from the scary internet, only allow the white list through.
    def node_params
      params.require(:node).permit(:name, :parent_id)
    end
end
```

### Views

Forms should submit new parents for tree nodes by submitting the `:id` of the parent as `"parent_id"`

#### Example dropdown

```
  <div class="field">
    <%= f.label :parent %><br>
    <%= f.collection_select :parent_id, Node.order(:name),:id,:name, include_blank: true %>
  </div>
```

## Querying

The `Tree` concern adds multiple ways of querying ancestors and descendants

#### `:parent`
The parent of the node.

#### `:children`
Direct children of the node. These are the other instances that have this node as their `:parent`.

#### `:ancestors`
Ancestors of a node, closest ancestor first. The ancestors are the node's parent, it's parent's parent, etc.

#### `:path`
Ancestors of a node, root first.

#### `:each`
The node and all of its descendants, depth first. Includes the node, the node's children, it's chidrens' children, etc.

#### `:descendants`
All of a node's descendants, depth first. The descendants are the node's children, it's chidrens' children, etc.

#### `:breadth_first`
The node and all of its descendants, breadth first.

#### `:decendants_breadth_first`
All of a node's descendants, breadth first.
